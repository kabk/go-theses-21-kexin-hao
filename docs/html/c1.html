        Nostalgia is about longing, especially for an unvisited place. It mourns for a displacement in time and space and yearns for either a realistic or a mythical return.

            Sir, if you come from Lo̍k-káng, the little town,<br />
            may I ask you, have you seen my parents?<br />
            My family lives at the back of Mazu temple,<br />
            that little grocery store that sells incense.<br /><br />

            Sir, if you come from Lo̍k-káng, the little town,<br />
            may I ask you, have you seen my lover?<br />
            When I left home she was eighteen.<br />
            She had a good heart and curly long hair.<br /><br />

            Taipei isn’t my home.<br />
            My hometown has no neon light.<br />
            Lo̍k-káng’s streets, Lo̍k-káng’s fishing villages,<br />
            people who burn incense in Mazu temple.<br /><br />

            Taipei isn’t my home.<br />
            My hometown has no neon light.<br />
            Lo̍k-káng’s early morning, Lo̍k-káng’s evening<br />
            and people who hover in the civilisation
          </span><br />
        <span class="italics">Lo̍k-káng The Little Town</span> is a song made in 1982 by the Taiwanese singer and songwriter Lo Ta-yu. People call him “the godfather of Taiwan music”. He has influenced many generations by his enlightening music and
        lyrics. And this song is one of the very first songs that made him known and recognised. Despite its musical value, it is an influential song as it shows big relevance to the time by criticising the urbanisation in Taiwan and mourning for
        the loss of rural life of people. Above all, it is a song of nostalgia that could hit everyone. “Taipei isn’t my home. My hometown has no neon light” is the iconic line that always lingers on, when someone misses home and the past, and is
        tortured by the metropolis. It carries not only a bitter sentiment but also a public complaint. Lo̍k-káng, a former unknown little town in Zhanghua, Taiwan, has become a symbol of peaceful rural living and the “good old days”. Lo̍k-káng then
        became a popular touristic spot and even a name for chain restaurants.
        <br /><br />
          However, generations of people who were so convinced that Lo̍k-káng is the hometown of Lo Ta-yu were “betrayed” by him. Lo had never been to Lo̍k-káng when he wrote the song. He revealed the story in an interview<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote">1</a></sup><div class="footnotes"></div>: Once he went to fix his motorbike in Taipei. He met this boy working at the repair shop and heard him saying: “It has been long I haven't been back home in Lo̍k-káng … I am having a hard time surviving here, and I have no face* going back.” (*In Chinese culture, having no face means that someone feels shameful. This boy had probably nothing to be proud of for his life then, so he would feel shameful in front of his family back home.) Lo was impressed and started to reflect on people’s suffering from urban-life stress. Therefore he wrote this song.
        <br /><br />
          Lo̍k-káng is a home neither of Lo Ta-yu nor most of the listeners. But everyone relates to it so much. The writer makes up a story based on a combination of their reality, other’s reality, and imagination. The recipient understands the story based on its relevance to reality but buys the story because of its distance to reality. This distance has created spaces for fantasies for both the songwriters and the listeners.
        <br /><br />
          Lo’s “betrayal” shows that, in a nostalgic narrative, it is not about going back to the real homes, but about longing for a different time, a different place, and better ones. Svetlana Boym, a media artist, playwright, and novelist, addresses it in Nostalgia and its discontents, that nostalgia is “not merely an individual sickness but a symptom of our age, a historical emotion” that could come from certain needs by the presence, “a rebellion against the modern idea of time, the time of history and progress”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote">2</a></sup>. Here, Lo Ta-yu expressed the urge for a “better” time, for a revisit to an unvisited place, where slow paces, nature, and religion are more valued. Even though he never visited the place himself, it could speak for him and the public. It is an urge that represents the public need, mixed with anger, sentiments, bitter-sweetness, and sweet-bitterness.

        <br />
        <span class="italics">A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty</span> is a song made by a heavy metal band formed in 1989 Beijing called Tang Dynasty—and perfectly explained their band name. Tang is an imperial dynasty ruling China from 618 to 907 and
        is famous for its great establishment in all kinds of aspects, such as its territorial expansion to central Asia, flourishing foreign trade (silk road), its art, literature, and religious life. In this song we could hear their scream for a
        return—a return to a fantasied world based on their knowledge of Tang Dynasty, where the economy, social structure, art and literature, as well as the cultural climate and people’s spirit are better. This imagined world is half an objective,
        factual construction, and half a virtual built-up, rendered with romanticism in the historical nostalgia: we can never return to the time.

            my home is inside the second ring<br />
            The people around here have so much time. <br />
            They talk about family gossip and watch what brand of cigarettes you are smoking<br />
            the folks working hard in little restaurants are not from here<br />
            their faces look like mine<br />
            bikes ride on fallen leaves watching the sunset<br />
            Yinding bridge watches the Mount Xishan but cannot see it<br />
            The lotus is in the water with its broken leaves<br />
            the moon in the reflection is in a negotiation with the street lamp<br />
            negotiating: who is gonna cook next morning<br />
            negotiating: biscuits or fried breadstick for breakfast<br />
            Bell Drum Tower is breathing the smoke<br />
            letting you paint its face<br />
            I cannot hear you<br />
            it’s too noisy now<br />
            You have been watching for this long<br />
            why don't you speak?<br />
            who asked the question? there are correct answers everywhere<br />
            who made this puzzle? All the answers are correct<br />
            my home is right inside the second ring<br />
            my home is right besides Bell Drum Tower<br />
            my home is right inside this big yard<br />
            my home, my home, my home is right on this earth
          </span>

          He Yong is from Beijing and wrote the song about Drum Bell Tower in 1994. The lyrics and music video both illustrated his life near the Drum Bell Tower and expressed his sadness and confusion when facing the fact that the neighbourhoods would lose the originality, the tradition, and its culture due to gentrification. Drum Bell Tower, same as Lo̍k-káng, has since become a token of nostalgia.
        <br /><br />
          Compared to <span class="italics">Lo̍k-káng The Little Town</span> and <span class="italics">A Dream Return to Tang Dynasty</span>, <span class="italics">Drum Bell Tower</span> is rather more “honest”, as it talks about a home the writer
        truly lived and the details he personally experienced. His nostalgia is about a wistful longing for a revisit to the visited.
        <br /><br />
          The iconic look of He Yong, which came out along with this song, tells another story. He always had a Breton shirt and a red scarf on. The red scarf is a neckerchief worn by young pioneers in China. It is a mandatory dress code in most Chinese elementary schools for three to sixth grades. The gesture of wearing a red scarf by He Yong might be a tribute to his childhood.

          Breton shirt was adopted by the Russian Navy in the 19th century from Brittany and became an iconic look and a symbolic item for Soviet sailors during World War II<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote">3</a></sup>. It has turned into a symbol of loyalty, courage, and manhood. In 1950s China, with the growing friendship between China and Russia, the Breton shirt has come into fashion and gained popularity among men. It has its unique translation in Chinese: 海魂衫, meaning “soul-of-sea shirt”. In 1957, the film Soul of Sea was released in China. The communist propagandist portrait of the national navy has again successfully won the heart of the audience with the iconic Breton shirt. However, born in 1969, He Yong had not been one of them. Wearing a Breton shirt speaks of his nostalgia for the time he didn't live in.
        <br /><br />
          Red scarf and Breton shirt—two symbolic items are both a tribute to the past of two timeframes. He Yong had lived in the former but had not lived in the latter. Playing with time, memories, and reminiscence, He has created a successful nostalgic collage. It has become a symbol, not only of He Yong but also of Beijing’s early rock scene. Until today, many people would still wear a Breton shirt and red scarf when going to rock music festivals<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote">4</a></sup>.
