          Nostalgia is a wistful gaze at a faraway place in time and space, a gesture of mourning for the displacement and yearning for a return. Nostalgia is also about belonging to a place or a community—the relationship between individuals and collectives—one must feel belonging to a place/time so that he would long for returning the place/time. One type of belonging is about belonging to a nation. The nostalgic feeling would hit, when one is outside of the homeland, no matter if the homeland sits in the presence, the past, the reality, or a mythical place.

            The orphan of Asia cries in the wind.<br />

            How many are trying to solve the puzzles?<br />
            How many are signing at midnight?<br />
            And how many are sweeping their tears in silence?<br />

          <span class="italics">The Orphan of Asia</span>, another famous song by Lo Ta-yu in the year 1983, sings about the wish for a return and a sense of belonging to the homeland—China (the “mother”), from a perspective of Taiwan (the “orphan”) in a certain time of history (the “White Terror”).
          <br /><br />
          The White Terror in this context is the suppression of political dissidents when martial law ruled Taiwan for 38 years from 1949 to 1987. It was triggered by an anti-government uprising against Kuomintang (Chinese Nationalist Party)’s corrupted conduct in 1947. Many people, whether were real or perceived as anti-Kuomintang, were imprisoned and killed in the early period. In the later period of White Terror, there was still harsh censorship on all cultural products.
          <br /><br />
          Taiwan, the “orphan of Asia” through Lo’s narrative, expressed its state of abandonment from China and isolation in Asia. After WWII, Japan stopped its colonial rule in Taiwan and handed over Taiwan to the Republic of China. After this, Kuomintang treated Taiwanese people by its corrupted conduct and violence. Taiwanese people had not enjoyed it long in the joy of returning to the motherland until realising how bad the motherland was treating them. <span class="italics">The Orphan of Asia</span> is an outburst of the long-repressed confusion, sorrow, mourning, and yearning: mother, why is it so?
          <br /><br />
          The nostalgia towards the motherland easily habituates in the Chinese cultural context, because there is a strong connection between a Chinese individual and the country. This connection roots in Chinese philosophy and language. Confucianism emphasises collectivism and hierarchy. It values the state as the top component of the world, and the family as the top component of a state<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote">5</a></sup>. In this value system, state and family are strongly connected—and this idea is still very present in today’s China as we can see slogans such as “the country is the home. The home is the country”<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote">6</a></sup>. This set of values had an etymological impact on the invention and development of the word “country”. The word “country” in Chinese is composed of two characters which respectively mean “nation” and “family/home”. It was a word meaning the imperial dynasty named after the family name of the emperor. Along with the idea of modern country, this word has developed into a word for “country” in modern Chinese<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote">7</a></sup>.
          <br /><br />
          The Confucianism backing and the etymological root support each other. Both in the consciousness(Confucianism values) and the unconsciousness(linguistic), a Chinese person always tends to connect the home to the country. By doing this, an individual builds a sort of intimacy with their homeland. Because it helps an idea of a state slip through your private zone and into your kinship. Especially when an individual is away from his homeland or feels any sort of forced departure or separation from his homeland, he feels the intimacy fused with nostalgia. And this departure or separation doesn't necessarily mean a physical one—you don't have to be physically away from your homeland, but also can be ideologically abandoned by a homeland, which was the situation depicted by Lo Ta-yu.
          <br /><br />
          While the patriot belonging roots in the Chinese culture and has its etymologic backing, the voluntary exile from the motherland is less favourable, both from a cultural and political sense. The “Fernweh” and “Wanderlust”, could be seen as a rebellious act, a denial of the national intimacy, and a breakup with the motherland.

            Don't ask from where I have come
            My home is far, far away
            Why do you wander so far
            Wander so far, wander so far

            For the little bird flying in the sky
            For the blue brook running in the mountain
            For the broad meadow green and wide
            I wander, wander so far

            Then, is there more?
            Yes, for the olive tree of my dream
            Don't ask from where I have come cMy home is far, far away

            Why do you wander?
            Why do you wander so far?
            Far, far away
            For the olive tree of my dream

            Don't ask from where I have come
            My home is far, far away
            Why do you wander so far
            Wander so far, wander so far

          <span class="italics">Olive Tree</span> was released in 1979 in Taiwan. It is well known for its remarkable role in the Taiwan folk song movement and pop music history because it was the first time classical music composition was introduced to pop music. Its beautiful, yet sad melody has passed on to generations of people.
          <br /><br />
          This song could be about anything but a political message. However, it was banned by the Taiwan authority for eight years<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote">8</a></sup>. The lyrics were originally from a poem by Sanmao (Echo), a Taiwanese writer who is famous for her travel-writing. This poem is clearly her true heart of “Fernweh”. The Taiwan authority at that time had the opinion that this song conveyed a passive message about despair, and that it talked about leaving to the mainland / overseas<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote">9</a></sup>.
