          Nostalgia is expressed in a different kind of language in China, in contrast to the west. In Chinese songwriting, it is a common attitude and technique to be universal, unspecific, impersonal, and to have vastness. The reasons behind deal with a complex combination of Chinese culture, the language, and semantics, and the author’s self-censorship as a reaction to the top-down censorship on cultural products. The “home”, in many nostalgic narratives in Chinese music, does not pinpoint an exact home of a person but could be applied to a general audience instead.
          <br /><br />
          The “home”, which <span class="italics">The Orphan of Asia</span> cries for, has multiple alternative versions of interpretation and relates to different social events. Lo and his audience seem to be able to accept all of the versions. In fact, the song has been always able to disclaim its connection to THAT White Terror, the one from 1949 to 1987 in Taiwan.
          <br /><br />
          Version 1: Since the song COULD BE about a very sensitive political issue, it could be banned by the government at that time, under the censorship on cultural products in the time of martial law. To avoid censorship, the graphic designer in Lo’s album production team came with an idea<sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote">10</a></sup>. He suggested Lo to add a note under the title of the song “A red nightmare — to all the refugees in Indo-China”. “Refugees in Indo-China”, according to Lo, referred to the leftover in Kuomintang troops that fled to the Burmese border region in 1950 after their defeat to the Communists in the Chinese Civil War<sup id="fnref:11"><a href="#fn:11" class="footnote">11</a></sup>. This social event was way less sensitive than the White Terror. Thanks to this note, the song was not censored. And many people have since believed that the song is about refugees in Indo-China.
          <br /><br />
          Version 2: In a recent TV program featuring Lo Ta-yu in 2016 hosted a Taiwanese famous music critic Ma Shifang, Lo was asked about this additional note on stage. He said the song is out of his sympathy for the refugees in Vietnam War, and he was inspired to making the song, after seeing the famous photograph of Phan Thi Kim Phuc, namely The Napalm Girl.

          Version 3: Lo performed this song at a benefit concert in 1991 in Hong Kong<sup id="fnref:13"><a href="#fn:13" class="footnote">13</a></sup>. In that year, a heavy flood hit eastern China and China was in aid for flood relief. This concert was held for a charity purpose. Lo went on the stage and sat in front of the piano. He said: “This song was written a long time ago. But today it should still sound honest”. He started playing. The camera then later zoomed out. On the LED screen on the stage, slogans said: “Drinking the same river, giving the same red heart” and “Blood must be thicker than water”. In this context, the “Orphan of Asia” represents easter China in a state of natural catastrophe. And it promotes solidarity within, through the rhetorics about motherhood and bonding.
          <br /><br />
          I believe Lo does not want the song to narrow down on one specific home. It refuses to be specific. The message is vague and open for interpretation. He wants to talk about motherhood from a Pan Asian perspective and apply it to whomever could relate to abandonment, isolation, confusion, and nostalgia. What Lo wants to say is: “it could happen here and now, but also there and then.”
          <br /><br />
          The choices of words in the song and the characteristics of the Chinese language have a big impact on its vagueness. In Chinese, a word, or a term is composed of multiple characters. A word/term has very many versions of its substitutes, in which only a single character is altered. For the term “White Terror/白色恐怖/bái sè kǒng bù”, Lo used an altered word “白色恐懼/bái sè kǒng jù”, which only alters the last character and still carries the same literal meaning. However, this altered version for “white terror” does not resonate with the historical term anymore, since it has lost its specification and precision, and a historical term is in most cases specific and precise. There could be many reasons why Lo chose this word. It could be that he wants it to rhyme, or it could be out of self-censorship.
          <br /><br />
          Here are two examples of English-written songs to demonstrate a very rough comparison between Chinese lyrics and English lyrics in contemporary pop music.<br /><br />
          In <span class="italics">Norwegian Wood</span> by The Beatles, the protagonist describes a simple story of an affair. The narrative is emotionless, objective, and diary-like. The plain tone seems not to have any effort in establishing further meaning other than retelling the facts. Thus, there is no evidence showing if the protagonist has any emotional connection with this encounter. Instead, he throws out random details in the event that people wouldn’t expect knowing—why would a listener want to know if she said anything about Norwegian wood? But the listeners eventually know what had happened in the story. And they can still notice that the protagonist is a bit underwhelmed. There is a sort of sadness or disappointment in it, but very minimised.

            I once had a girl<br />
            Or should I say she once had me<br />
            She showed me her room<br />
            Isn't it good Norwegian wood?<br /><br />

            She asked me to stay<br />
            And she told me to sit anywhere<br />
            So I looked around<br />
            And I noticed there wasn't a chair<br /><br />

            I sat on a rug biding my time<br />
            Drinking her wine<br />
            We talked until two and then she said<br />
            "It's time for bed"<br /><br />

            She told me she worked<br />
            In the morning and started to laugh<br />
            I told her I didn't<br />
            And crawled off to sleep in the bath<br /><br />

            And when I awoke I was alone<br />
            This bird had flown<br />
            So I lit a fire<br />
            Isn't it good Norwegian wood?

          In contrast to it, <span class="italics">The Orphan of Asia</span> doesn't describe anything that actually happened. It is not a chronological diary, but rather a collage of metaphors. There is no such a child crying in the wind, with red mud on his yellow face—these are all metaphorical expressions to express the feeling of abandonment.
          <br /><br />
          After The Beatles, musicians in modern music industries in the west have invented various music genres and written songs in all kinds of tones in favour of different social needs and trends. Diving into the vast sea of all types of English lyrics, I have come to the finding that, despite many nuances between one to another, songwriters in English lyrics writing (majorly from U.S, U.K and Australia) all prefer to write in the first person and individual perspective, also to share very personal stories and opinions. They like to zoom in on very particular things and expose an amazing amount of details of them. Instead, if we look at Chinese songwriting, we would notice there is less of “I” and more “we”. Songwriters would not waste any more words on describing what they did and whom they met. A more collective narrative, a bigger scope of time and space, and a more general point of view are more preferable in Chinese songwriting.

            Shakedown, 1979<br />
            Cool kids never have the time<br />
            On a live wire<br />
            Right up off the street<br />
            You and I should meet<br />
            Junebug skipping like a stone<br />
            With the headlights pointed at the dawn<br />
            We were sure we'd never see an end<br />
            To it all<br /><br />
            …<br />
            Double cross the vacant and the bored<br />
            They're not sure just what we have in store<br />
            Morphine city slippin' dues<br />
            That we don't even care<br />
            As restless as we are<br />
            We feel the pull<br />
            In the land of a thousand guilts<br />
            And poured cement<br />
            Lamented and assured<br />
            To the lights and towns below

          The Smashing Pumpkins’ song <span class="italics">1979</span> is one of the most nostalgic songs in alternative rock. The year 1979 is when the band’s frontman Billy Corgan turned 12, a transition into an adolescence<sup id="fnref:14"><a href="#fn:14" class="footnote">14</a></sup>. This song is a reminiscence of Corgan’s youth. The seemingly unnecessary details of events show an opposite approach in the writing compared to the Chinese ones from Lo Ta-yu and Chyi Yu, in which we find rather a lot more fictional and metaphorical elements. The former aims to sound real, personal, and honest; the latter tries to sound general, vast, and resonant with everyone. The former speaks out of the mouth, the latter wants to rhyme and recite.
