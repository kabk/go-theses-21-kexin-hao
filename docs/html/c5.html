          Svetlana Boym, in <span class="italics">Nostalgia and its discontents</span>, introduces a typology for nostalgia<sup id="fnref:17"><a href="#fn:17" class="footnote">17</a></sup>: restorative nostalgia which attempts a reconstruction of the lost home, and reflective nostalgia that focuses on the longing itself and delays the homecoming. The “home” in restorative nostalgia is about the origin, the tradition, the truth, the universal values, and the homeland, while “home” in reflective nostalgia is about the past in an irreversible time and the remembrance of it.
          <br /><br />
          It can be proved that there is a mixture of both restorative and reflective nostalgia in one song and its consumption (how people understand it and use it). The attempt of restoration and the remembrance of homes can happen at the same time. Sometimes they can transform from one to another.
          <br /><br />
          The song <span class="italics">Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies</span> is a folder of such a mixture. The nostalgic consumption deals with both the facts around the musician and the message in the music itself.

          <span class="lyricsbox" id="lyricsvast">
            Today I saw snow drifting through the cold night sky<br />
            Lost in the chill, my heart drifted off to faraway places<br />
            Catching up with the wind and the rain<br />
            Unable to tell the shadows apart from the fog<br />
            You and I, under the wide open sky<br />
            Will we change?<br /><br />

            Forgive me for indulging in my freedom all my life<br />
            Even though I am afraid one day I will stumble and fall<br />
            To abandon your hopes and dreams is easy to do<br />
            But I am not afraid if one day there is only me and you<br /><br />

            Still independent and free<br />
            Singing my sound out loud, for all the world to hear
          </span>
          The reflective nostalgia here, is about mourning for the lost member, for the “good old days” when he was alive, and how this period connects to the memory of the audience their own. The frontman and vocalist of the influential Hong Kong rock band Beyond, Wong Ka Kui, is for decades worshiped as the greatest musician in Hong Kong. He died from an accident during an entertainment show in Japan in 1993, the same year when he wrote this song. The song has become one of the most symbolic songs of Beyond and an elegy for Wong. The death of Wong remarks the end of the band’s most glorious period. Furthermore, the time when Wong played in Beyond, is also connected to the “good old days” in individual memories of the listeners. For the audience, the sorrow of Wong’s death is linked to a bitter sentiment about the loss of their own childhood and youth.
          <br /><br />
          In the restorative nostalgia, people’s reminiscence of Wong and the “good old days” of Hong Kong, shifts to a longing for the coming back to the “golden age” of Hong Kong and an attempt to restore the values of democracy and freedom in the society, encouraged by the message in the song:
          <br /><br />
          Forgive me for indulging in my freedom all my life<br />
          Even though I am afraid one day I will stumble and fall
          <br /><br />
          Regardless of the context where Wong wrote about freedom, the audience has brought “freedom” to a political context and used it in political rhetorics, where “freedom” directly links to freedom of speech and civil liberties. As a result, this song is used as an anthem for many social movements such as protests and events of memorials in Hong Kong.
          <br /><br />

          In the Anti-Hong Kong Express Rail Link movement in 2010, people gathered around the Legislative Council Building and started to sing Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies. Someone in the crowd asked: “if Ka Kui were alive, would he be with us today?” and someone answered: “Ka Kui is right here!”<sup id="fnref:18"><a href="#fn:18" class="footnote">18</a></sup> On October 1st 2014, the National Day of the People’s Republic of China, thousands of protesters in OCLP (Occupy Central with Love and Peace, a social campaign that advocates for a democratic electoral system) were singing this song while holding their cell phone’s flashlight in hands<sup id="fnref:19"><a href="#fn:19" class="footnote">19</a></sup>.
          <br /><br />
          <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/o4b58pzeRfw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
          <span class="italics">Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies</span> was also used as an anthem in 2019-20 Hong Kong protests(Anti-Extradition Law Amendment Bill Movement), where there has grown a strong nostalgic rhetoric. In the situation of Hong Kong in 2020, people witnessed a rapid decrease of democratic conduct under the increasing pressure from Beijing. They have also seen a loss of social safety in local circumstances and a loss of statues in an international context (Trump ordered the removal of special statues enjoyed by Hong Kong due to Beijing’s new national security law<sup id="fnref:20"><a href="#fn:20" class="footnote">20</a></sup>). These shreds of evidence and experiences of loss have resulted in a growing political nostalgia among people: "It was better yesterday. Hong Kong had more democracy and autonomy, and its people enjoyed more freedom in the past.” Indulging in this reminiscence of the better past, the people thrived to gain their rights back.
          <br /><br />
          Here, this restorative nostalgia is fuelled by the reflective nostalgia. People who feel sorrowful for Wong, for the loss of the “good old days” of both their youth and the society, tend to turn this sentiment into power in action in restoring the “good old days”. At the same time, the restorative action can also be discouraged and delayed by the reflective one, as soon as it decides to see the irreversibility of time and the impracticality of re-establishing the past. The restorative nostalgia will shift to a reflective one, once the restoration passion breaks down to a fragmental, personal remembrance of details in individual memories of the past.
          <br /><br />
          The way people consume this song shows a constant swing between these two types of nostalgia. There is a dynamic mixture and a grey area between the two ends.
          <br /><br />
          Although reflective nostalgia seems to suggest a permanent delay of the act of restoration, it is not equivalent to being powerless. Boym’s “diasporic intimacy”<sup id="fnref:21"><a href="#fn:21" class="footnote">21</a></sup> describes a state of nostalgia of immigrants, who live in voluntary or involuntary exile: they understand the limitations of nostalgia and challenge nostalgia through cherishing “non-native, elective affinities”. They accept the inability to return and turn it into an enabling force. <span class="italics">Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies</span> is also a song to carry the diasporic intimacy.

          In 2017, a video<sup id="fnref:22"><a href="#fn:22" class="footnote">22</a></sup> on Youtube got viral and reached 8 million views. The title is: <span class="italics">“A Japanese version of Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies performed on Tokyo’s street. A girl didn’t know he is Chinese, and cried in tears when he switched to Cantonese.”</span>

          In this video, a girl was watching the street artist’s performing the song Boundless Oceans, Vast Skies in Japanese. She started to cry when he started to sing in Cantonese because it surprised her that the artist could sing the song in its original language and that he speaks her mother tongue and he is Chinese.
          <br /><br />
          The performer, Wang Xiaokang told the story in an interview: It happened in January 2016. He didn’t know the girl is Chinese until she started to sing along in Cantonese. Then he started to sing in Cantonese too. He talked to the girl and got to know that she got married and moved from China to here 16 years ago. She missed home very much and was surprised that there was a street performer in Tokyo from China<sup id="fnref:23"><a href="#fn:23" class="footnote">23</a></sup>.
          <br /><br />
          In this context, this song carries out the homesickness of Chinese in Japan. And this homesickness applies to the Chinese-speaking/ethnic Chinese diaspora (from mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia, Singapore, etc) elsewhere all around the world. In the comments below the video, immigrant workers in the U.S, Japan, Australia, and Europe all have similar stories. They shared their experiences of hearing this song in a foreign place. It reminded them of home and the past. And the good memories could support them so that life goes on. They also talked about how much this song could bond people with different nationalities but the same linguistic common ground and similar immigration background. One person commented: “As long as there are ethnic Chinese people, there are boundless oceans and vast skies.”
          <br /><br />
          They do not look for a cure for this homesickness. Their nostalgia accepts the inability of homecoming—it verbalises and embraces the sentiments within. At the same time, it enables resonation and bonding experiences. “Homecoming” is replaced by “homemaking” as a strategy of survival.
