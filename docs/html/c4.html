           Since nostalgia is about longing for the past, the perception of “past” and the conception of time directly have an impact on how nostalgia works. The Chinese conception of time can be seen sometimes as a non-linear one. We can trace it out not only in traditional Chinese literature and philosophy, but also through the nostalgic narratives in pop music.

            You ask me whether I love you,<br />
            And if my love is true<br />
            All my love is real<br />
            Nothing to conceal<br />
            The moon represents my heart<br /><br />

            You ask me how much I love you,<br />

            My love will not change,<br />
            Not with time or age<br />
            The moon represents my heart<br /><br />

            Remember how we were<br />
            And the memory of your kiss<br />
            The love that we did share<br />
            I still long for and still miss<br /><br />

            You ask how deeply I love you,<br />
            And if my love is true<br />
            Well think about it, dear<br />
            And look around you here<br />
            The moon represents my heart
          </span>
           <span class="italics">Moon Represents My Heart</span> is a song that every east/south/south-eastern Asian can sing even without understanding Chinese. For almost half a century, it has sold and traveled to many places in Asia and is often cited as “one of the most famous and beloved Chinese songs of all time”. But has there anybody ever asked, “why does the moon represent my heart?”
          <br /><br />
           It is never explained in the song itself or by the songwriter. There is no logical connection being explained in the song between “moon” and “my love/my heart”. It seems like everybody already gets the idea. I believed that the moon has been long a common literary imagery in the Chinese language and culture so that no explanation is needed here. It had already been largely used in poetry and has gained its top popularity among poets in Tang and Song dynasties (AD 618 - 1279).
          <br /><br />
           I raised my head and looked out on the mountain moon,<br />
           I bowed my head and thought of my far-off home<sup id="fnref:15"><a href="#fn:15" class="footnote">15</a></sup>.
          <br />
           <span class="italics">A Tranquil Night</span> by Li bai
          <br /><br />
           This is the first Chinese poem we learn as a child. Moon already slips through even before we could form a sentence. Moon is engraved in common knowledge for Chinese-speaking as an imagery represents nostalgia and eternity: when you look at the moon, you know someone else is also looking at it. You know you, or someone else was looking at the same moon in the past. The moon is the same moon, but the time is a different time now. Then you miss the person, the home, and the time far away from you.
          <br /><br />
           The philosophical meaning of the moon and how it functions as a motive for nostalgic texts has something to do with the Chinese philosophical conception of time. Shuchen Xiang, a scholar of Department of Philosophy, University of York, explains it as follows:
          <br /><br />
           “Unlike the Western tradition which treats time as an inferior to
           eternal being, the Chinese tradition understands the reality of experience within
           becoming itself. The remembrance of time’s passing thus becomes a kind of
           metaphysical experience, to remember the past is to remember that humans are
           indelibly part of an eternal cycle of change.”<sup id="fnref:16"><a href="#fn:16" class="footnote">16</a></sup>
          <br /><br />
           And the moon is the perfect natural reference to help materialise this understanding—the moon always changes and the change itself is eternal. in Water Song, a poem in the Song Dynasty, Su Shi wrote: “People have sorrow and joy; they part and meet again and again. The moon dims or shines; it waxes and wanes again and again.”
          <br /><br />
           This conception of time in the cycle of change suggests an alternative way of looking at time-passing in Chinese nostalgic pop songs. In the world of the moon, time is not linear. The remembrance of old times, places, and people doesn’t point at the impossibilities of going back. Instead, it advocates the acceptance of the constant return and constant departure.

            Pitch-dark eyes and beautiful smile, <br />
            it is so hard to forget the changes of your face during time pass.<br />
            The old time is light as a feather and slipped out on the sly, <br />
            only when I turned back, just realised how many years have pass already.<br /><br />

            Boundless road of the world is the end of your wander, <br />
            but endless searching to be together is my non-stop pace.<br />
            In dark night, it is your tenderness by the side of my lonely pillow, <br />
            in the dawn, it is my melancholy following with my waking.<br /><br />

            Maybe, tomorrow in the sunset, when the tired bird flew back to nest,<br />
            you may also set forth on return journey to old times.<br />
            It is rare in life to find out another soulmate, <br />
            and after all, it’s hard to live without a blue sky.<br /><br />

            Loudly thunder falls in front of my window, <br />
            the change after you left is unforgettable.<br />
            After the lonely figure is the lonesome mood, <br />
            but after my eyes is no regret.<br /><br />

           In <span class="italics">Love Song 1990</span>, Lo wrote about the nostalgia for an old lover and the old times. The narrative is about the remembrance of the lover in the past and the sadness for the change in the present. Besides this linear conception of “past-present”, there is another non-linear conception of time in the lyrics. It plays with time, and “time” plays together with “space”. The “past”, “present” and “future”, together with “here” and “there”, are woven together.

           Maybe, tomorrow(forwards in time) in the sunset, when the tired bird flew back to nest(backward in space),<br />
           you may also set forth(forwards in space) on a return journey(backward in space) to old times(backward in time).
          <br /><br />
           With these lines, this song suggests a gesture that looks both back and forward. the protagonist is looking forward to a return, in an unconventional construction of time-space. In here, “becoming” is at the same time “returning”. The “back” and “forth”, “becoming” and “returning” do not oppose each other. Instead, they are all circling. These two lines set out a tune of hope in the song, saying “my old lover and I will still meet again”. Yet the realisation of it stays mysterious.
